To run the bot, the PyCord module must be installed (on linux, `pip3 install py-cord`).
If you found any trouble, you can report it at the issues section.
Sometimes if the pip3 command is not detected, it may be that `pip` command is already associated with python3 (check it running the command `pip --version`).
