# AntiScam
Discord bot code to stop users that are scamming with fake messages of free discord nitro on servers in order to steal users accounts.  

# How to use
Here is an example image of the most simple main python script to run a discord bot to avoid discord massive scams on servers.

To run the bot, the PyCord module must be installed (on linux, `pip3 install discord.py`).  
More info about how to install discord.py is in their docs: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html  
If you found any trouble, you can report it at the issues section.  

If you don't know how to create a discord bot or how to manage server permissions, here is a video made by S4vitar of how to do that: https://youtu.be/k0e_AnL5UeE  
Thanks for S4vitar and all those Hack4u moderators who helped me with the testing and for improbing this bot with the aim of stoping this type of scam on discord servers!  

# Update
Because of a discord api modification, you might need to enable the "Message Content Intent" option on the Discord Developer Portal if you wanna have no problems.  
That's also why this repo have been updated, it was deprecated because of the change.  
**IMPORTANT:** The python module dependency have been changed, remember if you had already a bot working with this code to uninstall py-cord and install discord.py.
